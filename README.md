# scum-sram-evaluation

Contains the results obtained by [reading the start-up values of the SCuM SRAM many times](https://github.com/bkorecic/scum-automated-sram-read),
and also code for analyzing relevant metrics and generating plots.

## Structure

The project consists of three directories:

* `results/` contains the results generated by the [scum-automated-sram-read](https://github.com/bkorecic/scum-automated-sram-read) repository.
The filename format for the files in it is `<chip-id>-<YYMMDD>-<hhmmss>.pickle`, and it is important to follow for the analysis to work.
* `analysis/` contains Python code for analyzing different metrics that are relevant to the SRAM PUF evaluation. See its [README](analysis/README.md) for more information.
* `utils/` contains useful scripts for working with the results.
